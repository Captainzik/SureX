A Decentralized Insurance Smart Contract on The Binance Smart Chain Network.
Insurance is often regarded as either being a mutual organism, where everyone is going to the same place, together; or an adversarial system where the objectives of policy holders and shareholders stand opposed. 

We want to demonstrate that blockchain technology enables us to create ecosystems of cooperation, where individual objectives can be mutually aligned, so instead of everyone going to the same place we can all go in the same direction... towards a better financial future.

To achieve this outcome, we propose a hybrid mutual–investment model, where we create an ecosystem for everyone to mutually benefit, even though we all aren’t in the same space.
